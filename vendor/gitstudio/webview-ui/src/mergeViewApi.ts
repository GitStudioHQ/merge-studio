// the orchestrator. `MergeView` (mergeView.ts) implements it; P1 owns that body.
//
// No monaco import here, on purpose: the interface is what the shell may rely
// on. The concrete class keeps its public editors (`left` / `result` / `right`)
// and `model` for tests that inspect Monaco decorations directly.
