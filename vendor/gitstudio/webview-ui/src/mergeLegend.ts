// The merge view's colour legend: it explains the COLOURS the panes show, in
// words, each beside a solid dot of that colour and the count still to do —
//
//   ● Conflict — you choose 6 · ● Same on both sides — either arrow takes it 1
//   · ● One side only — safe to take 5 · ● Removed lines 2   (?)
//
// — and a "?" key for the MARKS (a point line, word highlights, a taken
// side's muted band, a discarded side's outline, a half-decided Result).
// Clicking an item goes to the next change of that colour.
//
// The colours are JetBrains' dark merge colours, which the owner picked (24
// Sep 2026), by the DECISION a change needs (paint.ts): orange, you choose;
// green, the same change on both sides; blue, one side only — and grey for
// lines removed without a conflict, on one side or the same on both. One
// colour, one answer — the owner's rule, after the per-type paint made a
// same-on-both change blue one time and green the next. Yours-only and
// Theirs-only are one item; the tooltip says how many of each, and the
// toolbar's "Apply non-conflicting changes: Yours / Theirs" already speaks
// per side.
//
// No symbols of our own: the owner found invented glyphs (≠ = ‹ › ≈ ✨) not
// self-explanatory, and small bordered squares read as unticked checkboxes.
// Words carry the meaning, for everyone and for colour-blind users in
// particular; a dot only ties a word to a colour, and the count is the plain
// number badge VS Code puts beside a tab's name.
//
// Built here and mounted by the shell through MergeViewApi.attachLegend: the
// shell owns WHERE it sits, the view owns WHAT it says and keeps it current on
// every change. Names and counts are set as text nodes only — never innerHTML
// with data.
