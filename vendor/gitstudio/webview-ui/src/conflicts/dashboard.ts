// The conflicts dashboard: every conflicted file of the stopped operation, what
// can be done to each, and the way out of the operation itself.
//
// Ported from Merge Studio's conflictsHtml.ts, where it was an inline <script>
// inside a template literal — a string to tsc and esbuild, so neither ever saw
// its code. This is a typed DOM component instead, mounted as-is by the
// extensions' webview panel (conflicts/main.ts) and natively by the desktop's
// Changes view. It keeps everything Merge Studio had — the operation chip, the
// progress bar, the rows with their badges, whole-file Accept Yours / Accept
// Theirs, Merge…, resolution pills, hold-to-undo, the success card, Close —
// and adds what issue #12 asked for: the direction bar ("test → onto →
// master"), the commit being replayed and "commit N of M", and Continue / Skip /
// Abort, each gated the way git gates it and confirmed inline.
//
// The component holds no git state. The host sends a full ConflictsState after
// every change; the component posts ConflictsActions and nothing else. Every
// name it shows — a branch, a path, a subject — is written as a text node.
//
// A state is painted IN PLACE (patch.ts): the page is built from the state
// into a detached copy and only what differs is written to the screen, so
// resolving one file changes that file's row, the progress bar and the footer
// and nothing else — no row, button, hover, focus or scroll position is
// thrown away. A state identical to the one on screen is not painted at all.
//
// A ROW's action (Accept Yours / Theirs, Delete the file, Hold to undo) is
// that row's alone: it shows its own working state (a spinner, its buttons
// waiting behind it) until the host says it has finished that press (`done`,
// by the press's `seq`), and no other row is written to — not locked, not
// greyed, not re-enabled. A press on another row meanwhile is not refused: it
// shows ITS working state and the host runs it next. Only an operation verb
// (Continue / Skip / Abort) locks the page, with one class on the dashboard.
