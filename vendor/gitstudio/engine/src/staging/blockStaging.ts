 * Tri-state staging over whole diff blocks — the model behind a tick beside
 * each change in a diff.
 *
 * WHY BLOCKS AND NOT LINES. `applySelectedChanges` promotes an entire diff block
 * whenever a selected range touches any part of it, so a tick offered per LINE
 * would stage more than it showed. Probed against the engine: original
 * `a b c d e` against modified `a B C D e` is ONE hunk, and selecting only the
 * middle line yields `a B C D e` — all three changed lines staged. The tick
 * therefore spans a block, and the block is the unit the whole model is built on.
 *
 * WHY HEAD ↔ WORKING AND NOT INDEX ↔ WORKING. Tri-state only exists if the index
 * is not one of the two sides. Diffed against the index, every visible change is
 * unstaged by definition, so a tick could never be anything but empty — a
 * checkbox that cannot be checked. Diffing HEAD against the working tree shows
 * every change since the last commit, and the index then decides which of them
 * are already staged.
