// Side mapping and labels (PLAN §3.1, W2): the ONE place that knows which git
// stage is "Yours". Pure — no vscode / node / monaco import.
//
// Decision D1: during a rebase "Yours" is YOUR commit being replayed — git's
// stage 3 — and it is drawn on the LEFT, as JetBrains does
// (GitMergeUtil.java: `CURRENT = isReversed ? theirsContent : yoursContent`).
// A stash re-apply is reversed the same way: stage 3 holds the changes you
// stashed. Merge, cherry-pick, revert, am and a `--rebase-merges` merge step are
// NOT reversed: stage 2 is the branch you are standing on.
//
// Why the contents swap and not only the titles: git's stage 2 during a rebase
// is the branch you are rebasing ONTO. "Accept Yours" that took stage 2 (git
// checkout --ours) followed by Continue silently removed the reporter's only
// commit from their branch (issue #12, scratchpad git-semantics/products.out).
// A label-only fix leaves "left = mine" false in exactly the case that loses
// work.
//
// Every host maps contents, missing sides, badges and the JetBrains LOCAL /
// REMOTE files through `byRole` / `stageOf` / `roleOfStage` below and never
// re-derives the swap (memory: fix-both-siblings). Flipping D1 is one column:
// `YOURS_STAGE`.
