/**
 * Drop Commit (issue #32): take one commit out of the current branch and
 * replay the ones after it.
 *
 * It is the drag-to-reorder chain (chain.ts) with that one commit set to
 * `drop` — the same first-parent run from HEAD, the same rule that a merge
 * cannot be replayed past — with one difference: a PUBLISHED commit is not a
 * stop here. Reordering refuses to begin a republish with a drag; dropping is
 * a menu item and a confirmation, so it is allowed, and the confirmation says
 * plainly that it rewrites pushed history (`publishedWarning`).
 *
 * Pure by design — no git, no DOM. The caller runs
 *   git rev-list --first-parent HEAD
 * and hands the result here; this decides whether the commit can be dropped
 * and what gets replayed.
