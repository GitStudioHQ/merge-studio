 * by the desktop main process and the VS Code host package, so the dashboard's
 * rows, badges and resolutions cannot drift between products.
 *
 * The rules, each paid for by a destroyed file somewhere:
 *
 * - `ls-files -u -z` decides which stages exist. A MISSING side is never
 *   inferred from a failed checkout: Merge Studio's "rm on any checkout error"
 *   deleted the working file whenever checkout failed for any reason at all.
 * - `-z` and an exact path comparison, never a C-quoted listing (four of six
 *   non-ASCII files were deleted by that once).
 * - git moves the bytes (`checkout --ours|--theirs -- p`), never a string
 *   round trip: a PNG came back 36,078 → 67,288 bytes of U+FFFD.
 * - Every write goes through ONE guard (a usable path, lexically inside the
 *   repository, and not reached through a symlinked parent), and every
 *   pathspec is literal. The desktop had two writers and each had half of the
 *   guards (memory: fix-both-siblings); both now come through here.
