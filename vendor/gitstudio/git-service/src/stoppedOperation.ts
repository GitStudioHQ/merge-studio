// What git is ALREADY stopped in, for a door about to run a command — and the
// sentence for a command refused over it.
//
// A command that applies commits (a merge, a rebase, a cherry-pick, a revert,
// a checkout, a stash apply or pop) — or a pull — meets a repository that is
// mid-merge, mid-rebase, mid-pick, mid-revert or mid-`git am`, or that has
// files left unmerged by a stash. git refuses most of them there ("Merging is
// not possible because you have unmerged files", "You have not concluded your
// merge", "It seems that there is already a rebase-merge directory", "your
// local changes would be overwritten by cherry-pick" over the staged
// resolution), and that is the user's state, not a defect: said in the app's
// words, never git's, and never filed.
//
// Read by the operation core (OperationProvider.detect — the files git
// writes, locale-free, through `rev-parse --git-path` so a linked worktree's
// markers are found), never by a list of its own. The doors used to keep one,
// and it missed `git am` and a cherry-pick or revert with nothing left
// unmerged: their staged resolution was then read as "your uncommitted
// changes" and offered to Stash & Retry, which stashed it OUT of the
// operation.
