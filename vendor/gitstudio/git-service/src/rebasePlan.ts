// Turning the rebase planner's on-screen list into git's todo script.
//
// This is the one place display order becomes git order, and it is shared by the
// extension's rebase workspace and the desktop's Rebase view because getting it
// wrong is silent: the rebase reports success and the history is wrong.
//
// The list is NEWEST FIRST on screen, matching the Commits list (issue #18).
// git's todo file is the opposite — oldest first, replayed top to bottom — so the
// rows are reversed exactly once, here, and everything downstream works on the
// reversed plan.
//
// Two things depend on that and fail quietly if they are left reading the display
// order instead:
//
//   · rewords. RebaseRunner looks these up BY SHA when git opens the editor.
//     They used to be a bare list popped once per editor call, which is only
//     correct while nothing interrupts the run — see `rewords` below.
//   · squash/fixup meld into the entry BEFORE them in the file. After the flip
//     that is the row BELOW on screen, which is why the "first commit can't be a
//     squash" guard has to run against the reversed plan, not the visible top row.
