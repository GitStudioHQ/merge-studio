/**
 * A record of what an operation is about to change, and — once it has run and
 * `settle` has looked — what it DID change. This is the mechanics behind
 * GitStudio's Undo envelope; the extension's UndoLedger persists these.
 *
 * Undo used to restore by resetting whatever branch HEAD was on NOW to the
 * commit HEAD had been at before. That is only right for an op that moved
 * HEAD's own branch. Undoing "Checkout feature" reset FEATURE onto main's
 * commit; undoing "Delete branch" restored nothing and said it had; undoing a
 * pop threw the popped work away. So a snapshot records the op's SCOPE —
 * HEAD's branch (or detached commit), every local branch, the stash stack and
 * the uncommitted state — and `settle` keeps exactly what differs after the
 * op. `plan` then says, in words, what putting back THOSE things means, or
 * why it can't be done safely; `restore` does it and nothing else.
 *
 *   headSha  — the commit HEAD pointed at before.
 *   stashSha — a `git stash create` commit of the uncommitted index + tree
 *              before (null when clean). Captured without touching them.
 *   ref      — HEAD's branch before, short (null when detached). For words.
 *   label    — the operation (for words).
 *   scope    — what the op may change, and what it did (see SnapshotScope).
