/**
 * Checking out a remote branch — "origin/fix/1.0.1-quality" → local
 * "fix/1.0.1-quality" — without asking anything first.
 *
 * Lives in git-service, not in either app, because both need it: the extension's
 * Branches view and graph menu, and the desktop app's graph menu (issues #12/#19).
 *
 * Both entry points (the Branches view and the graph's per-ref menu) used to
 * open a text prompt pre-filled with the name they had already worked out, so
 * the answer was almost always "yes, that one". A rename dialog in front of a
 * checkout gets in the way of the common case to serve a rare one that is
 * already served better elsewhere: check out, then rename; or create a branch
 * from the remote under any name you like.
 *
 * The two-step decision below replaces `git checkout <short>` DWIM on purpose.
 * DWIM is convenient but conditional — it is off when `checkout.guess=false`,
 * and it refuses outright when several remotes carry the same branch name,
 * which is exactly when guessing would be wrong anyway. Asking whether the
 * local branch exists costs one `rev-parse` and always lands somewhere
 * predictable.
