/**
 * "Reset 'feature' to 'origin/feature'" — make a local branch match a remote
 * branch exactly, dropping whatever it has that the remote does not (issue
 * #32: "in IDEA you can just checkout the same branch from origin and it
 * throws everything local away and makes it 1:1 with origin").
 *
 * Planned here, free of any host, so every door means the same thing — the
 * extension's branch menu ("Reset to 'origin/feature'…" on a branch that
 * tracks one) and its "Checkout origin/feature" over a local branch that has
 * moved on — and so the whole plan runs against real git in tests.
 *
 * The order is fixed: name the target, FETCH it (the point is to match the
 * remote as it is now, not as it was at the last fetch), then read what the
 * reset would take away, then — only after the person has seen that — reset.
 *
 * What it hands git is never a short name:
 *   · the branch is read as refs/heads/<name>. Beside a tag of the same name,
 *     "release" is the tag;
 *   · the target is a refs/remotes/ name, and the reset lands on the SHA the
 *     question was asked about, so a background fetch between the question
 *     and the answer cannot change what was agreed to;
 *   · the checked-out branch is reset with `reset --hard <sha>` — its name
 *     never reaches argv — and any other branch is moved with
 *     `branch -f -- <name> <sha>`, which git itself refuses for a branch
 *     checked out in any worktree (including one being rebased there).
