/**
 * Checking out a pull request as the local branch `pr/<n>` — deciding what
 * that means for the branch that may already be there. Both products use it:
 * the extension's Pull Requests view (pr/checkoutPr.ts) and the desktop app's
 * PR page (main/githubBridge.ts prCheckout).
 *
 * The old way was one command, `git fetch <remote> [--force] pull/<n>/head:pr/<n>`,
 * which is wrong three ways:
 *   · with pr/<n> CHECKED OUT, git refuses to fetch into it ("refusing to
 *     fetch into branch … checked out") — a checked-out PR could never be
 *     brought up to date;
 *   · with --force (the extension), commits made on pr/<n> that the PR does
 *     not have were thrown away without a word — alive only in the reflog;
 *   · without it (the desktop), any force-push to the PR made the checkout
 *     fail outright.
 *
 * Now the PR head is fetched on its own (into FETCH_HEAD, nothing written to
 * a branch), and then:
 *   create        — no pr/<n> yet: create it there and check it out
 *   current       — pr/<n> is already at the PR head
 *   fast-forward  — pr/<n> is behind the PR head and has nothing of its own:
 *                   move it (a fast-forward merge when it is checked out)
 *   diverged      — pr/<n> has commits the PR head does not: NOTHING is moved
 *                   until the user says so
 *   elsewhere     — pr/<n> is checked out in another worktree: git will not
 *                   switch to it here, and it is not moved under that worktree
 *
 * Only the ref is decided here; the checkout itself goes through each
 * product's in-the-way door (applyOrAsk / applyForDoor), which asks about
 * uncommitted work in its way.
