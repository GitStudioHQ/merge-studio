  /**
   * `git pull`, with the reconciliation decided HERE rather than left to git.
   *
   * Since 2.27 git refuses a pull outright when the branch has diverged from
   * its upstream and neither `pull.rebase` nor `pull.ff` is set. What it prints
   * is advice for a terminal — "You have divergent branches and need to specify
   * how to reconcile them", then three `git config` lines — and that wall is
   * exactly what a GitStudio user saw when they pressed Pull (report #12).
   *
   * So:
   *
   * - `mode` (or the legacy `rebase`) is passed as `--rebase` / `--no-rebase` /
   *   `--ff-only`. Explicit, one invocation, and **nothing is written to the
   *   user's git config** — the choice belongs to the press, not to the repo.
   * - With no mode and no configuration of their own, we pull `--ff-only`,
   *   which is the one reconciliation that can never surprise anyone. If that
   *   refuses, we ask git for the ahead/behind counts — a fact, not a parse of
   *   its English — and hand the caller a `diverged` result to ask about.
   *   `--ff-only` aborts before touching the worktree, so nothing has changed.
   * - With no mode but `pull.rebase` / `pull.ff` / `branch.<name>.rebase` set,
   *   we get out of the way: the user has already told git what they want, and
   *   a plain `git pull` does it.
   *
   * Two failures are answered as facts rather than as git's text:
   *
   * - A merge or rebase that STOPPED on conflicts comes back `stopped` (see
   *   `PullStop`). Recognised the way `pausedForUser` recognises a paused
   *   cherry-pick — exit 1 AND files left unmerged — never by reading git's
   *   English. The exit code is what keeps a REFUSAL out: pulling while an
   *   earlier merge is still unresolved is refused with 128 before anything
   *   runs, and those conflicts are not this pull's.
   * - A pull that could not REACH the remote is never a divergence, whatever
   *   the remote-tracking ref says. git's pull returns 1 when its fetch fails
   *   and dies (128) on its own refusals, `--ff-only`'s included — and the ref
   *   a failed fetch leaves behind is from the last fetch that worked, so it
   *   can show a divergence that asking about would only answer with this same
   *   transport error. Both codes are pinned against real git in
   *   test/pullStopped.test.ts.
   * - A pull over an operation still stopped — a merge or rebase a stop left
   *   the user in, with the branch still ahead and behind, or a cherry-pick,
   *   a revert, a `git am` — is not run at all and comes back `blocked` (see
   *   `PullBlock` and pausedByOperation): running it can end the operation or
   *   move HEAD out from under it, and any answer to "merge or rebase?" would
   *   meet the same stop.
   * - A pull refused because the user's uncommitted work is in its way comes
   *   back `dirty` (see `PullDirty`) — work in progress, not a failure.
   * - `pull.ff=only` in the user's config is treated as the auto case above:
   *   it makes a mode-less pull `--ff-only`, so a diverged branch is the same
   *   question, not git's advice.
