// Dropping a commit is the drag-to-reorder pipeline with that one commit set to
// `drop`: the first-parent chain from HEAD (engine/rebase/drop.ts decides what
// may be dropped), `buildRebasePlan` for the todo, `runRebasePlan` to run it.
// This module is the git half — reading the chain, the checks a drop owes the
// user before it rewrites anything — so the extension's graph menu and the
// desktop's do the same thing. The words (the question, how it ended) are the
// engine's, pure, so the desktop's renderer can say them too. Each host brings
// only its own dialogs, its own runner binding and its own undo.
