// The merge-parity contract: ONE vocabulary for "which operation is stopped,
// which side is yours, and what can be done next", shared by the GitStudio
// extension, Merge Studio and the desktop app, and by the conflicts dashboard
// every one of them mounts.
//
// IMPORTANT: this module must stay free of any `vscode` / `node` / `monaco`
// import — the webviews (browser context) and the desktop renderer import it,
// and the engine/host-bridge purity guard (scripts/check-engine-purity.sh)
// covers it. Types plus a few frozen data constants only; no logic.
//
// FROZEN after the S0 contract seed (merge-parity/seed). A change goes through
// the orchestrator and is re-broadcast to every package building against it.
//
// Vocabulary (PLAN §3.1, decision D1/D2):
// - "Yours" / "Theirs" are ROLES, never git stages. During a rebase (and a
//   stash re-apply) Yours is git's stage 3 — your commit being replayed — and
//   it is still drawn on the LEFT. Everywhere else Yours is stage 2.
// - The ONLY code that decides which stage a role maps to is `describeSides`
//   (packages/engine/src/conflict/sides.ts). Everything else reads
//   `op.yours.stage` / `op.theirs.stage` and never reinterprets a side.

 *   re-apply. Heuristic — falls back to "none" when the markers are gone.
 * - "none": nothing recognisable is in progress. May still have unmerged
