 * and the desktop app so this security-critical logic can never drift between
 * them. Pure and environment-neutral (no `node:*` imports), so it belongs in
 * this host-agnostic package and is exercised directly in test/scrub.test.ts.
 *
 * This is the last line of defense before anything leaves a user's machine.

/**
 * Remove anything that could identify a user or their work: private keys, home
 * dirs, absolute paths (POSIX, Windows, and UNC — with or without spaces in
 * them) INCLUDING the file/project names in the tail, remote URLs (creds AND
 * org/repo), SSH remotes, emails, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, JWTs, cloud/access
 * tokens, and SHAs.
 *
 * Order matters — each step assumes the earlier ones already ran:
 *   - private-key blocks are nuked whole, before anything can partially match;
 *   - URL/remote redaction runs before the email pass (so an embedded token or
 *     an `org/repo` path is stripped before `user@host` collapses to `<email>`);
 *   - path redaction preserves a trailing `:line:col` (it stops at the first
 *     `:`) so crash stacks stay locatable without leaking file names;
 *   - JWT/AWS/SHA passes run before the generic long-token pass so they get a
 *     precise label instead of a blanket `<token>`.
