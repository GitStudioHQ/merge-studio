// The automatic-routing decision table (PLAN §3.7 W14, matrix rows 2–4, 6, 44).
//
// Two routes send a conflicted file into the product's resolver without being
// asked:
//   1. the ACTIVE-EDITOR route — a conflicted file becomes the active text
//      editor (Merge Studio's model; GitStudio used to open EVERY conflicted
//      file as its own tab instead);
//   2. the BUILT-IN TAB REROUTE — VS Code opens its own 3-way merge editor for
//      a conflicted file (git.mergeEditor), and we replace that tab.
//
// Both are pure functions of their inputs so every row of the table is a unit
// test; the listeners that feed them live in autoRouteHost.ts.
//
// One `autoOpen` meaning gates both routes AND the dashboard auto-show. The
// exit guard gates both routes (Merge Studio's reroute ignored it). D4:
// `defers` (another product owns automatic behaviour) gates both.
