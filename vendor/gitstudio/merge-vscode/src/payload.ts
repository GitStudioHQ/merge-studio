// The merge editor's init payload (host → webview), built ONE way for both
// extensions (PLAN §3.1, D1/D2).
//
// The contents come from `ConflictOps.readSides`, which has already mapped git's
// stages to ROLES through the operation (`byRole`): during a rebase or a stash
// re-apply, Yours is stage 3 — the user's own commit — and it is drawn on the
// LEFT. This module never looks at a stage number. It copies Yours into
// `ours` (left) and Theirs into `theirs` (right), and the pane titles from
// `op.yours.paneTitle` / `op.theirs.paneTitle`. The webview never swaps.
//
// Before this, both extensions read `git show :2:` into the left pane under a
// fixed "Current change" title, so during a rebase "Accept Yours" took the
// upstream branch — merge-studio#12, and the case that silently dropped the
// reporter's only commit on `rebase --continue`.
//
// vscode-free, so it is unit-tested against real git under plain node.
