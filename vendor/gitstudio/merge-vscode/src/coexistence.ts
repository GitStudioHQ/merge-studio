// The question about VS Code's own merge UI (PLAN matrix row 5; POLISH A5.2).
//
// VS Code's built-in 3-way merge editor (`git.mergeEditor`) and the
// merge-conflict extension's CodeLens and decorations compete with ours for
// the same file. The product asks whether to turn them off:
//
// - in BOTH products at the FIRST CONFLICT — someone who never merges is never
//   asked (Merge Studio used to ask with a modal at first activation);
// - NON-modally, as a toast with three answers — never a modal, never the
//   Changes view's in-view dialog popped from a background scan (it could
//   collide with a dialog already open there);
// - recorded ONLY after an explicit answer: "Turn them off" and "Don't ask
//   again" are remembered (and synced); "Not now" and a dismissal are not, so
//   the question comes back at the next conflict. It used to be recorded
//   before it was shown, so a question that never appeared was never asked;
// - reversibly: the values it changes are saved first, and "<Brand>: Restore
//   VS Code's Merge Editor" writes them back (the confirmation toast offers it
//   as Undo too).
//
// Nothing is asked when nothing competes, or while another product owns the
// automatic behaviour (D4). A product standing down says so instead, once
// (maybeSayDeferred).
