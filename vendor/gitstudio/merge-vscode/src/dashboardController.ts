// The conflicts dashboard's state machine (PLAN §3.7 W14, matrix rows 45–54).
// vscode-free: the panel host (conflictsPanel.ts) feeds it git snapshots and
// user events, and does what it decides.
//
// Rules, each a unit test:
// - EPISODES. Everything is keyed by `op.episode` (kind + REBASE_HEAD /
//   CHERRY_PICK_HEAD / …, derived by git-service): the rows come from
//   `ConflictOps.snapshot()`, which already resets its resolved-row memory per
//   episode, and this controller resets ITS memory — the user's close, the
//   pending count it compares against — on the same key. Merge Studio kept one
//   list for the whole session, so resolved rows from rebase step 1 piled up
//   under step 2 (matrix row 54).
// - CLOSE IS RESPECTED FOR THE EPISODE. Closing the dashboard while conflicts
//   remain keeps it closed until the episode changes (the next rebase step
//   stops) or every conflict is gone. Merge Studio re-opened it on the next
//   git event, so it could not stay closed (row 46). Asking for it (the
//   command, the status item) always shows it.
// - REVEAL ON A PENDING DROP. When a file stops being pending, an open
//   dashboard comes back to the front — JetBrains' flow: finish a file, return
//   to the list.
// - CLOSE WHEN THE OPERATION ENDS ELSEWHERE. Nothing in progress and nothing
//   unmerged, after there were conflicts, and no outcome of ours to show →
//   close. When OUR Continue / Abort ended it, the dashboard stays to show the
//   outcome ("Rebase complete.") until the user closes it.
